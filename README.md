### About
Cuketypenium is a framework for writing selenium driven cucumber-jest tests using Typescript.

### Getting started

- Run ```yarn``` to install the dependencies 
- Add your base url to the test/test.config.ts file 
- Add your CSS selectors to the selector.config.ts file 
- Create your BDD scenarios in .feature files
- Populate your page objects 
- Implement your step definitions 
- use the ```yarn test``` command and you're away...

You'll find some examples that can be edited to get things moving, I'll add some simple example tests soon, I promise.
